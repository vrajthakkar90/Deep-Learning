Labs and projects

Data Visualization and Regression: Visualization techniques, data inference, Confidence Metrics, Regression

House price prediction           : Regression models(self coded, scikit), ANNs

Lab_on_Cifar                     : Batch Normalization, Skip Connections, CNNs

Mnist_dataset                    : ANN with adam, Node dropout

Segmentation                     : Unet architecture on pet segmentation data, CNNs

Project                          : In a group we tried using novel techniques of replacing back propogation with more biologically plausible algorithms like feedback alignment(FA) and 
direct feedback alignment(DFA) on various datasets and architecture.
